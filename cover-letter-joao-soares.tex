\opening{Good morning,}{Frontend Developer - Berlin, Germany on LinkedIn (11.02.2017)}

	I am excited to learn of your job opening because I have been searching for a company just like yours to challenge my programming skills and improve my personal strengths in a motivated and highly functional team. In reviewing my resume, you will find that I possess all the attributes of a perfect match, from programming skills mainly in Javascript and built tools like Gulp to programming successfully over 8 web applications surrounding REST API services, web mapping applications and open public data.  

	During my four years of experience as a Full-stack Software Developer I have gained major experiences in developing strong and stable web tools such as TerrasMap, MapBiomas, SAD Plus and CarMap. I possess a large knowledge of frontend architectures that I developed through personal studies and work experiences with Javascript frameworks. After working with several tools, automation tools like Gulp.js are my personal preference to create sustainable and solid software architectures. Additionally to my capability of using javascript frameworks like AngularJS, Backbone.js and JQuery I have an excellent judgement on deciding which one is the better choice for a specific goal in order to create and refine web systems. Furthermore I am constantly researching new styleguides and include them successfully in my projects. I am especially fond of some styleguides developed by Johnpapa, a reputed developer from Google. By modeling web pages I acquired a large experience in handling tools like Compass, CSS3, HTML5 and Canvas HTML5.

One of my major projects was the MapBiomas project, a cooperation between international and Brazilian institutions for visualizing annual land use. In preparation for this project I participated in the Google Earth Engine User Summit in California where I attended the initial meeting of MapBiomas. Throughout the whole cooperation I worked in an international team where my major responsibilities were the front-end development of the MapBiomas workspace.

As my experiences illustrate I am particularly well-qualified for the position and besides my experiences I am also thrilled to learn new skills and methods to find the best solution for any problem. In doing so I do not spare any effort or time to find potential weak spots and investigate new approaches to improve the user experience. I thrive in an atmosphere of challenge, I am a quick learner and team player with a positive attitude and energy.

I believe that I can very comfortably meet your requirements as the ideal candidate for this position and enthusiastically anticipate discussing your specific needs and my ability to meet them in an interview.
Thank you very much in advance for your consideration.


\closing{ I look forward to speaking with you on thursday.}
