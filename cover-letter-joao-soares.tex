\opening{Dear Ms. Coghie,}{Full Stack Software Engineer - Berlin, Germany on LinkedIn (02.01.2020)}

I am excited to learn about your job opening because I have been searching for a company just like yours to challenge my software engineer skills and improve my strengths in a motivated and highly functional team. In reviewing my resume, you will find that I possess all the attributes of a perfect match, from programming competence in JavaScript (ReactJS, Redux, AngularJS, Jasmine, NodeJS, ExpressJS), HTML, CSS (Bootstrap, Sass), SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL) and REST APIs to developing, maintaining and improving stable and robust web applications.

During my seven years of experience as a Full-stack Software Developer, I have gained extensive knowledge of frontend as well as backend architectures that I developed through work experiences in proactive international teams and personal studies. As a team player with a positive attitude and energy, I love to discuss possible options with my colleagues as well as encourage the team to keep a high software quality by doing code review, refactoring and pair programming. Along with these practices, I acquired an excellent capability to analyse stakeholder's needs and feedbacks, which allow me to bring refined insights and accurate estimation to the workgroup efforts.

My acquired expertise affected not only my career but also had an impact on the achievements of the companies that I have worked for. My current employer \href{https://www.realxdata.com/}{Realxdata} has a solid reputation as a software innovation startup in the German PropTech market, which supplies the real estate industry with big data analysis. My previous employer \href{http://terras.agr.br/}{Terras App Solutions} in Brazil, is a company that affords geospatial applications for the Brazilian agribusiness market and helps farmers track their productions and finances. In both cases, I was one of the first employees in the firm, and I helped to build a robust, competitive and prominent business from the beginning until maturation. As my experiences illustrate, I am particularly well-qualified for the position. I thrive in an atmosphere of challenge, I am a quick learner, and I do not spare any effort or time to find potential weak spots which will boost the gain of KAYAK.

I believe that I can very comfortably meet your requirements as the ideal candidate for this position and enthusiastically anticipate discussing your specific needs and my ability to meet them in an interview. I look forward to introducing myself personally to you, maybe in an opportunity in the comings weeks.

\closing{ Thank you very much in advance for your consideration.}
