\opening{Dear Mr. Simaria}{Junior Android Developer - Berlin, Germany on your web page (18.02.2017)}

{\justifying I recently talked to Robson Monteiro from Hello Fresh in Berlin, and he strongly recommended that I apply for this position. Knowing the requirements of your open position you will find in reviewing my resume, that I possess all the attributes of a perfect match from skills in programming Java to communication skills and being a teamplayer.\par}  
{\justifying During my four years of experience as a professional Android Developer I have gained major experiences in developing, maintaining and improving three strong and stable Android apps like Monitoramento de Pragas, Terras Monitoramento and Agrogestor. I possess a large knowledge of building REST API's and in addition to my experiences of Android platforms I have a broad and object oriented knowledge of Java. Through my studies I include Design Patterns, Clean Code and Unit Testing for daily code working into my projects. I draw upon the experiences I gained with unix shell in diverse purposes such as the basic manipulation of files and folders and the setup of tools like vim, docker, tmux, ssh and git. Especially in the case of using git I gained major knowledge due to the daily use of branches, tags, pull and merge requisitions, whether on the command line or in Github, GitLab and Bitbucket tools. Considering my proven experiences I have an excellent judgement on deciding which tool is the best choice for a specific goal in order to create and refine Android applications.\par}
{\justifying One of my major projects was the MapBiomas project, a cooperation between international and Brazilian institutions for visualizing annual land use. In preparation for this project I participated in the Google Earth Engine User Summit in California where I attended the initial meeting of MapBiomas. Throughout the whole cooperation I worked in an international team where my major responsibilities were the front-end development of the MapBiomas workspace.\par}
{\justifying Since 2014 I am an active and passionate member of the Brazilian Python community and attended the national conferences in 2016, 2015 and 2014. Besides that I participate regularly in hangouts and I am conducting coding dojo sections as a tutor. In 2015 I founded with five friends the community PyNorte  from the Amazon region of Brazil with already more than 130 participants and currently we are organizing the first regional PyCon Amazônia conference which will take place in Manaus in August this year.\par}
{\justifying As my experiences illustrate I am particularly well-qualified for the position. I am also thrilled to learn new skills and methods and improve my personal strengths in a motivated and highly functional team. In doing so I do not spare any effort or time to find potential weak spots and investigate new approaches to improve the user experience. As a team player with a positive attitude and energy I love to discuss possible options with my colleagues to identify reasons and specify goals with the aim of finding the best solution together. I thrive in an atmosphere of challenge, I am a quick learner and my ability to apply new technologies and skills will boost the gain of Hello Fresh.\par}
{\justifying I believe that I can very comfortably meet your requirements as the ideal candidate for this position and enthusiastically anticipate discussing your specific needs and my ability to meet them in an interview.\par}


\closing{ Thank you very much in advance for your consideration. I look forward to speaking with you next week.}
